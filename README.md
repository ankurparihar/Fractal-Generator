## Fractal-Generator
Generate fractal pattern from IFS rules

[Live Demo](https://ankurparihar.github.io/projects/fractal-generator)

## Iterated Function System
In mathematics, iterated function systems (IFSs) are a method of constructing fractals. The resulting fractals are often self-similar. [Widipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system)

## Features
- Add custom IFS rules
- Tweak and experiment with existing rules
- Visualize fractal generation process step by step
- Control the speed of simulation
